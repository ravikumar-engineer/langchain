    <!-- Main Title -->
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>

    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on
        creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that normally
        require human intelligence.
    </p>

    <p>
        These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception,
        and understanding natural language.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2>History of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
        The concept of artificial intelligence dates back to ancient times, but
        the formal field of AI was founded in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference.
    </p>

    <h3>Early Development</h3>
    <p>
        During the 1950s and 1960s, researchers believed that human-level intelligence
        could be achieved within a few decades.
    </p>

    <h3>AI Winter</h3>
    <p>
        Due to limited computing power and unrealistic expectations, AI research
        faced multiple periods of reduced funding known as AI winters.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2>Types of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
        AI systems can be classified based on their capabilities and functionalities.
    </p>

    <h3>Narrow AI</h3>
    <p>
        Narrow AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as facial recognition
        or voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.
    </p>

    <h3>General AI</h3>
    <p>
        General AI refers to systems that possess human-like intelligence and can
        perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
    </p>

    <h3>Super AI</h3>
    <p>
        Super AI surpasses human intelligence in all aspects, including creativity,
        decision-making, and emotional understanding.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2>Applications of Artificial Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
        AI is widely used across multiple industries to improve efficiency and
        decision-making.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Healthcare: Disease diagnosis and drug discovery</li>
        <li>Finance: Fraud detection and algorithmic trading</li>
        <li>Education: Personalized learning systems</li>
        <li>Transportation: Self-driving cars</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2>Advantages and Challenges</h2>

    <h3>Advantages</h3>
    <p>
        AI increases productivity, reduces human error, and enables automation
        of repetitive tasks.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
        Ethical concerns, data privacy, job displacement, and bias in AI models
        are major challenges that need to be addressed.
    </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is transforming the way humans interact with
        technology. With responsible development, AI has the potential to greatly
        benefit society.
